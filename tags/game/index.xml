</p>
<p><a href="https://ratethatcrypto.com/">Rate That Crypto</a> is a new game I was introduced to by one of my friends, actually one of the co-founders. It&rsquo;s a game
where you can stake points on cryptocurrency fluctuation predictions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Climb your way up the leaderboard by making accurate price predictions and multiplying your points. The highest ranking players will earn our native $RTC token, with an additional bonus draw taking place for loyal community members.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You get some points when you start, and you can earn more by watching ads. Of course, you get a multiple if your predictions come true.</p>
<h2 id="day-to-day">Day to day</h2>
<p>Every day you can watch three more ads to get more points. I keep having to do that as I go all-in for my predictions. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m doing it right, but I&rsquo;m having fun :-)</p>
<p>I even got it right once! (I&rsquo;m using an Android phone):</p>

</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>I need to read the news section of the app more and pay attention. I&rsquo;m not doing well!</p>

</p>
<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>
<p>I was a bit late to the app, so wasn&rsquo;t a beta tester. I did however find two bugs that have now been fixed:</p>
<ol>
<li>I got the app into a weird situation where I could keep watching ads forever. I racked up the points :-)</li>
<li>The app wouldn&rsquo;t take any stakes, but logging out and back in fixed it. Support were very helpful.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m running the Android version which is very fast to load and feels slick. My closing thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I like the idea of using points and earning more each day to keep playing</li>
<li>The news feed is good</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d like to see the graphs of the coins have a period on them (I think it&rsquo;s 24 hrs) so you can see the trend</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d like email notifications</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, it&rsquo;s fun, and I&rsquo;m going to keep playing. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll be able to keep up with the top players, but I&rsquo;ll give it a go!</p>
