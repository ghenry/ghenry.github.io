[{"content":"Protect your SIP Servers from bad actors Introduction SentryPeer® is a fraud detection tool. It lets bad actors try to make phone calls and saves the IP address they came from and number they tried to call. Those details can then be used to raise notifications at the service providers network and the next time a user/customer tries to call a collected number, you can act anyway you see fit.\nFor example:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say you are running your own VoIP PBX on site. What SentryPeer will allow you to do in this context, is dip into the list of phone numbers (using the RESTful API) when your users are making outbound calls. If you get a hit, you\u0026rsquo;ll get a heads-up that potentially a device within your network is trying to call known probing phone numbers that have either been:\nNumbers collected by SentryPeer nodes you are running yourself Numbers seen by other SentryPeer nodes which have been replicated to your node via the peer to peer network This would allow you to generate a notification from your monitoring systems before you rack up any expensive calls or something worse happens.\nWhat would lead to this scenario?\nPotential voicemail fraud. This can happen if you allow calling an inbound number (your DID/DDI) to get to your voicemail system, then prompt for a PIN. This PIN is weak and the voicemail system allows you to press \u0026lsquo;*\u0026rsquo; to call back the Caller ID that left a voicemail. The attacker has left a voicemail, and they then guess your PIN and call it back. The CLI is a known number that SentryPeer has seen. You can alert on it. A device has been hijacked and/or a softphone or similar is using the credentials they stole off the phone\u0026rsquo;s GUI and is trying to register to your system and make calls to a number seen by SentryPeer. An innocent user is calling a phishing number or known expensive number etc. that SentryPeer has seen before. Traditionally this data is shipped to a central place, so you don\u0026rsquo;t own the data you\u0026rsquo;ve collected. This project is all about Peer to Peer sharing of that data. The user owning the data and various Service Provider / Network Provider related feeds of the data is the key bit for me. I\u0026rsquo;m sick of all the services out there that keep it and sell it. If you\u0026rsquo;ve collected it, you should have the choice to keep it and/or opt in to share it with other SentryPeer community members via p2p methods.\nFeatures All code Free/Libre and Open Source Software FAST User owns their data User can submit their own data if they want to (you need to enable p2p mode - -p) User gets other users\u0026rsquo; data ONLY IF they opt in to submit their data to the pool Embedded Distributed Hash Table (DHT) node using OpenDHT (-p cli option) Peer to Peer sharing of collected bad_actors using OpenDHT (default on) Peer to Peer data replication to receive collected bad_actors using OpenDHT (default on) Set your own DHT bootstrap node (-b cli option) Multithreaded UDP transport TCP transport TLS transport JSON logging to a file SIP mode can be disabled. This allows you to run SentryPeer in API mode or DHT mode only etc. i.e. not as a honeypot, but as a node in the SentryPeer community or to just serve replicated data SIP responsive mode can be enabled to collect data - cli / env flag Local data copy for fast access - cli / env db location flag Local API for fast access - cli / env flag WebHook for POSTing bad actor json to a central location - cli / env flag Query API for IP addresses of bad actors Query API for IPSET of bad actors Query API for a particular IP address of a bad actor Query API for attempted phone numbers called by bad actors Query API for an attempted phone number called by a bad actor Fail2Ban support via syslog as per feature request Local sqlite database - feature / cli flag Analytics - opt in SDKs/libs for external access - CGRateS to start with or our own firewall with nftables Small binary size for IoT usage Cross-platform Firewall options to use distributed data in real time - DHT?

For those interested, see my full podcast show list (https://www.se-radio.net/team/gavin-henry/) for Software Engineering Radio\nDocker You can run the latest version of SentryPeer with Docker. The latest version is available from Docker Hub. Or build yourself:\nsudo docker build --no-cache -t sentrypeer . sudo docker run -d -p 5050:5060/tcp -p 5060:5060/udp -p 8082:8082 -p 4222:4222/udp sentrypeer:latest Then you can check at http://localhost:8082/ip-addresses and http://localhost:8082/health-check to see if it\u0026rsquo;s running.\nEnvironment Variables ENV SENTRYPEER_DB_FILE=/my/location/sentrypeer.db ENV SENTRYPEER_API=1 ENV SENTRYPEER_WEBHOOK_URL=https://my.webhook.url/events ENV SENTRYPEER_SIP_RESPONSIVE=1 ENV SENTRYPEER_SIP_DISABLE=1 ENV SENTRYPEER_SYSLOG=1 ENV SENTRYPEER_PEER_TO_PEER=1 ENV SENTRYPEER_BOOTSTRAP_NODE=mybootstrapnode.com ENV SENTRYPEER_JSON_LOG=1 ENV SENTRYPEER_JSON_LOG_FILE=/my/location/sentrypeer_json.log ENV SENTRYPEER_VERBOSE=1 ENV SENTRYPEER_DEBUG=1 Either set these in the Dockerfile or in your Dockerfile.env file or docker run command.\nInstallation Debian or Fedora packages are always available from the release page for the current version of SentryPeer:\nhttps://github.com/SentryPeer/SentryPeer/releases\nHomebrew (macOS or Linux): We have a Homebrew Tap for this project (until we get more popular):\nbrew tap sentrypeer/sentrypeer brew install sentrypeer Alpine Linux: SentryPeer is in testing on Alpine Linux, so you can install it with the following command:\napk -U add --no-cache -X https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing sentrypeer Ubuntu Package You can install SentryPeer from our Ubuntu PPD which is currently for Ubuntu 20 LTS (Focal Fossa):\nsudo apt install software-properties-common sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gavinhenry/sentrypeer sudo apt-get update This PPA can be added to your system manually by copying the lines below and adding them to your system\u0026rsquo;s software sources:\ndeb https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/gavinhenry/sentrypeer/ubuntu focal main deb-src https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/gavinhenry/sentrypeer/ubuntu focal main Then you can install SentryPeer:\nsudo apt-get install sentrypeer Building from source You have two options for installation from source. CMake or autotools. Autotools is recommended at the moment. A release is an autotools build.\nIf you are a Fedora user, you can install this via Fedora copr:\nhttps://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/ghenry/SentryPeer/\nIf you are going to build from this repository, you will need to have the following installed:\ngit, autoconf, automake and autoconf-archive (Debian/Ubuntu) libosip2-dev (Debian/Ubuntu) or libosip2-devel (Fedora) libsqlite3-dev (Debian/Ubuntu) or sqlite-devel (Fedora) uuid-dev (Debian/Ubuntu) or libuuid-devel (Fedora) libmicrohttpd-dev (Debian/Ubuntu) or libmicrohttpd-devel (Fedora) libjansson-dev (Debian/Ubuntu) or jansson-devel (Fedora) libpcre2-dev (Debian/Ubuntu) or pcre2-devel (Fedora) libcurl-dev (Debian/Ubuntu) or libcurl-devel (Fedora) libcmocka-dev (Debian/Ubuntu) or libcmocka-devel (Fedora) - for unit tests Debian/Ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install git build-essential autoconf-archive autoconf automake libosip2-dev libsqlite3-dev \\ libcmocka-dev uuid-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libpcre2-dev libjansson-dev libmicrohttpd-dev Fedora:\nsudo dnf install git autoconf automake autoconf-archive libosip2-devel libsqlite3-devel libcmocka-devel \\ libuuid-devel libmicrohttpd-devel jansson-devel libcurl-devel pcre2-devel macOS:\nbrew install git autoconf automake autoconf-archive libosip cmocka libmicrohttpd jansson curl pcre2 then (make check is highly recommended):\n./bootstrap.sh ./configure make make check make install Running SentryPeer Once built, you can run like so to start in debug mode, respond to SIP probes, enable the RESTful API, enable WebHooks and enable syslog logging (use a package if you want systemd):\n./sentrypeer -draps SentryPeer node id: e5ac3a88-3d52-4e84-b70c-b2ce83992d02 Starting sentrypeer...
